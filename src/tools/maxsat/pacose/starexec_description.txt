Pacose is a SAT based MaxSAT solver choosing between two incremental CNF encodings, a binary adder and the Dynamic Polynomial Watchdog DPW, for Pseudo Boolean PB constraints. It is an extension of QMaxSAT 2017 and is based on Glucose 4.2.1 SAT solver. It uses a BMO pre  inprocessing method to simplify the instances. A trimming method is applied to cut off unsatisfiable soft clauses and find a good initial satisfiable weight to reduce the size of the encoding.
