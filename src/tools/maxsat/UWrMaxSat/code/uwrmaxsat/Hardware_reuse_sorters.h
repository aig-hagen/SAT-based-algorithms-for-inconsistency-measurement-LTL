/* An input sequence to the sorter consists of element of type Formula with possible repetitions.
   Each sequence is sorted and the repetitions are counted. If the count is <= 7, it is stored on 
   the 3 least significant bits of the element (they are all zeroes in the input values); otherwise,
   the counter is added as the next element to an vector with unique elements only. Previous input 
   sequences are stored in this way in the vector prev_elem. A greedy algorithm is used to find previous 
   sequences that are subsequences of the currect one. If found, they are replaced in the current one 
   with a pairs of elements: a constant Subseq and an index of a subsequence in prev_seq. Those special 
   pairs are put at the beginning of compacted current sequence.
